Note:: use ```python setup.py sdist``` for building package

```wxpython-installer``` never actually installs as a package itself so
pip never detects ```wxpython-installer``` because it's not in site-packages

This means we don't need to worry if the user uninstalls ```wxpython``` separately
because ```wxpython-installer``` is never actually installed on the system
and won't stop on the ```wxpython-installer``` requirement already met"
